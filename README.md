# Queue-Linked-List

**QUEUE (FIFO)**

Queue → abstract data type with the following operations:
enqueue(key) → adds key to collection
dequeue() → removes and returns least recently-added key
Empty → are there any elements?
Implement it with Linked List by adding new elements to the ListNode tail, and popping elements from ListNode head.

Enqueue → List.PushBack();
Dequeue → List.PopFront();

Each queue operation is O(1) → enqueue, dequeue, empty.
